## 1. Purpose of This Constitution

This document defines the **supreme principles, boundaries, and governance authority**
of the **AcaPro AI Education Agent Platform**.

It exists to ensure that:

- The platform evolves coherently across years and versions
- AI Agents operate with **educational responsibility and decision traceability**
- High-risk academic systems (e.g. VCE, ATAR, examinations) are governed with control and ethics
- No future code, model, agent, or commercial pressure can override core platform values

This Constitution **supersedes all other documents, roadmaps, and implementations**.

---

## 2. Platform Identity

### 2.1 Platform Name
**AcaPro AI**

### 2.2 Platform Nature

AcaPro AI is an:

> **AI Education Agent Platform**  
> designed to support **high-stakes learning systems**  
> through structured decision-making, execution, feedback, and adaptation.

It is **not**:
- A chatbot
- A content-only tutoring tool
- A generic recommendation engine
- A score-optimisation machine

---

## 3. Core Mission

> **To build AI Agents that guide, decide, and adapt learning paths  
> for students operating under high-risk academic systems,  
> with transparency, responsibility, and measurable outcomes.**

Primary focus domains include:
- Australian VCE (Years 10–12)
- High-risk examinations
- Structured curriculum systems
- School-to-tertiary transition pathways

---

## 4. Foundational Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 4.1 Agent-Centric Architecture

All intelligence on the platform MUST be implemented as **Agents**, not static logic.

Every Agent MUST:
- Have a clearly defined role
- Declare its input and output boundaries
- Operate within explicit decision authority
- Be auditable, versioned, and replaceable

---

### 4.2 Decision Over Content

The platform prioritises:
1. Learning decisions
2. Execution strategies
3. Feedback loops
4. Outcome evaluation

Content exists **only to support decisions**, never to replace them.

---

### 4.3 High-Risk Education Responsibility

For high-stakes systems (e.g. VCE):

- AI MUST NOT hallucinate certainty
- AI MUST surface uncertainty and confidence levels
- AI MUST prefer safe escalation over forced answers
- All recommendations MUST be traceable to reasoning steps

---

### 4.4 Human-in-the-Loop by Design

AcaPro AI enforces:
- Teacher override capability
- Parent visibility where applicable
- Student agency and consent
- Mandatory human checkpoints in high-risk decisions

---

## 5. Ethical Guardrails

The platform SHALL NEVER:
- Replace certified teachers in authority
- Manipulate assessment outcomes
- Optimise scores at the cost of learning integrity
- Conceal uncertainty or system limitations

All AI guidance MUST be:
- Explainable
- Reversible
- Logged and auditable

---

## 6. Data and Knowledge Principles

### 6.1 Learning Data Ownership

- Students own their personal learning data
- Schools retain institutional records
- AcaPro AI acts solely as a **data custodian**

---

### 6.2 Knowledge Graph as Source of Truth

All adaptive intelligence MUST reference:
- Curriculum-aligned knowledge graphs
- Versioned syllabus mappings
- Explicit skill and misconception nodes

No Agent may operate purely on free-form inference
within critical learning paths.

---

## 7. Platform Scope and Boundaries

## 8. Governance Authority

### 8.1 Constitutional Supremacy

---

## 10. Long-Term Vision Statement

> AcaPro AI exists to define

> not merely how fast it generates answers.

This platform is designed for:
- Decades, not demos

# AcaPro Agent Constitution

**Repository:** acapro-agent-constitution  
**Role:** Platform Constitutional & Governance Canon  
**Standard:** 2026 Skill / Agent Platform  
**Status:** Authoritative · Binding · Versioned

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository defines the **constitutional foundation** of the AcaPro AI platform.

It exists to:

- Establish non-negotiable platform principles  
- Define agent, skill, decision, data, and risk governance  
- Enforce long-term architectural integrity  
- Prevent uncontrolled AI behavior in high-stakes education contexts  

All platform implementations, services, and commercial layers  
**MUST comply with the documents in this repository**.

---

## Constitutional Authority

Documents in this repository are **binding**.

In case of conflict:

1. Platform Constitution overrides all other documents  
2. Architectural and governance specifications override implementations  
3. Commercial or operational pressure does **not** override constitutional rules
